Introduction
-------------
CBehave - A Behavior Driven Development Framework for C.

Main Features
-------------

 - use the "feature + scenario" structure which is (inspired by Cucumber)
 - use classical "given-when-then" template to describe the behavior scenario
 - support mock

A Typical Example
-------------

An example:

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <errno.h>
    #include "cbehave.h"

    FEATURE(1, "strstr")
      SCENARIO("The strstr finds the first occurrence of the substring in the source string")
 
         GIVEN("A source string: [Lionel Messi is a great football player]")
             char *str = "Lionel Messi is a great football player";
         GIVEN_END
 
         WHEN("we use strstr to find the first occurrence of [football]")
             char *p = strstr(str, "football");
         WHEN_END

         THEN("We should get the string: [football player]")
             SHOULD_STR_EQUAL(p, "football player");
         THEN_END
     SCENARIO_END

     SCENARIO("If strstr could not find the first occurrence of the substring, it will return NULL")

        GIVEN("A source string: FC Barcelona is a great football club.")
            char *str = "FC Barcelona is a great football club";
        GIVEN_END

        WHEN("we use strstr to find the first occurrence of [AC Milan]")
            char *p = strstr(buf, "AC Milan");
        WHEN_END

        THEN("We should get no string but a NULL")
            SHOULD_STR_EQUAL(p, NULL);
        THEN_END
     SCENARIO_END
    FEATURE_END

    int main() {
        cbehave_feature strstr_features[] = {
           {feature_idx(1)},
        };

        return cbehave_runner("Strstr Features are as belows:", strstr_features);
    }

    Strstr Features are as belows:
    Feature: strstr
     Scenario: The strstr finds the first occurrence of the substring in the source string
         Given: A source string: Lionel Messi is a great football player
         When: we use strstr to find the first occurrence of [football]
         Then: We should get the string: [football player]
     Scenario: If strstr could not find the first occurrence of the substring, it will return NULL
         Given: A source string: FC Barcelona is a great football club.
         When: we use strstr to find the first occurrence of [AC Milan]
         Then: We should get no string but a NULL
     Summary:
     total features: [1]
     failed features: [0]
     total scenarios: [2]
     failed scenarios: [0]

Build
------
 - Download the source code package
 - unzip the package
 - configure->make->make install
 
if you want to compile in 64-bit mode, pass "CPPFLAGS=-m64 LDFLAGS=-m64" to configure.

sometimes, you may encounter such error:

     mv: cannot stat `.deps/cbehave.Tpo': No such file or directory
     make[1]: *** [cbehave.lo] Error 1
	
a solution for this is execute "libtoolize -f" before "configure".


User Guide
-------------
For more information, please open and read the project wiki. cbehave user guide is ready for you.

ToDo
----
- proper autoconf integration (not symlinks)
